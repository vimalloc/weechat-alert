This is a simple application that acts as a weechat relay client, and alerts
you (via sounds and tray area alerts) when new irc messages come in. This is
useful if you are running weechat behind tmux/mosh on a seperate server

Rust probably isn't the best language for this, but I've wanted to dabble in
it recently, and now seems a good o time as any.
